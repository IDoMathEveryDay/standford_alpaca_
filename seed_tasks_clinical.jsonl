For fertility women: You must agree to maintain an ascetic (triplex with reason) or use the contraception as defined below. Women are ascetic during the administration for at least five months after the administration of the dosage period and for at least five months after the last administration of the last administration of Paclitak Cell or toxin Rubbi/Epi Rubicin, or during the last 12 months after the last administration of Cyropommide. Keep or use a contraception with an annual failure rate. Women should refrain from donating eggs during the same period. After menarche and postmenopausal state (continuous ≥ 12 months weapons without being identified other than menopausal), women who do not receive surgical infertility (ovarian and/or uterine resection) are considered fertility.

The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the period of clinical trials and the usual lifestyle preferred by the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g. menstruation, ovulation, symptom body temperature, or ovulation method) and non -vaginal assessment are not appropriate contraception.

Men must refrain from donating sperm during this period. Men with pregnant female partners are involved during the administration period for 6 months after the dosage period and paclitaxel or paclitaxel or toxin Ruby Shin/Epirubi Shin's last administration or during the last 12 months after the last administration Keep or use condoms.
